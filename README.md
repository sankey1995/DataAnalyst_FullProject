# DataAnalyst_FullProject
Tools - Advance Excel,PowerBi,SQL,Tableau
"Welcome to my data analyst project, where I used a variety of tools to derive insights from employee data and create a comprehensive dashboard for employee retention analysis.

The project involved working with large datasets from HR records, and I used a variety of tools to extract, transform, and load the data. I leveraged advanced Excel functionalities such as data validation, conditional formatting, and pivot tables to clean and organize the data. I also used SQL to join multiple tables and extract data needed for analysis.

Once the data was organized and cleaned, I used Tableau to create a variety of visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and heat maps to understand the relationships between different employee attributes such as age, gender, department, and job role. This allowed me to identify trends and patterns that were important for employee retention.

Finally, I used Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that incorporated all of the insights from the analysis. The dashboard included a variety of metrics such as average monthly income stats, attrition rate, work-life balance, year since last promotion, and working hours by department and job role. The dashboard allowed HR managers to quickly and easily monitor and analyze employee retention data and make informed decisions based on the insights derived from the data.

Overall, this project was an excellent opportunity for me to showcase my skills as a data analyst and use a variety of tools to extract insights from complex datasets. I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques and contribute to the data analysis community.
